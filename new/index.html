                        Design work. I have a strong understanding of design process and methods that focus on the user and usability of
                        products from a wide range of industries. Highly adaptable to any industry, I have spent the most time in the financial
                        space working on enterprise software tools solving complex data presentation and long user flows in the banking and mortgage industry. I have also worked
                        on a wide range of consumer facing SaaS products and features in the in-flight entertainment industry.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        I studied Industrial Design in college and have been educated in discovering needs of users, creating products that are
                        intuitive and helpful with an emphasis on visual design. I have taken this education and enhanced it with an in depth
                        UX/UI program and real professional experience working on digital products. I have always been a strong advocate for
                        the user while also understanding the needs of a business and technical constraints. I have been mentored for
                        leadership and lead junior designers through many projects and helped strengthen any team that I have been on.</p>
